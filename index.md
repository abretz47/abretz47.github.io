## Welcome to Aaron's Portfolio for Product Management!

### 1) <a href="https://github.com/abretz47/abretz47.github.io/memo.md" target="memo">Application Support  Memo</a>
The reader should be able to get a glipse of Aaron's ability to troubleshoot and explain difficult application support issues. This was a memo written prior to a large meeting of business stakeholders needing an understanding of the details surrounding a series of application outages. 

### 2) <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/ePV00JSMUCSmvNLR4BsnHI/Hierarchical-View-(Public)?node-id=373" target="proto">Dashboard Prototype</a>
The reviewer should get an understanding of Aaron's approach to application design, which includes an emphasis on functionality informed by hours of user interviews with an appreciation for an intutive experience. The reviewer can click on the frames that flash when the screen is clicked to get understanding of screen flow. This particular prototype was a dashboard that was being developed to help a construction organization organize and surface crucial details of their 100,000+ in-flight construction jobs. The basic idea is that anyone from VP of Construction to Project Manager could quickly orient themselves to the volume of jobs that was appropriate for their decision making. Development is currently in progress.

### 3) <a href="https://github.com/abretz47/foresight" target="app">Hobby Project</a>
The reviewer should note Aaron is proficient in the latest JavaScript patterns and enjoys technical solution creation. So much so, that Aaron does this in his free time. The app itself is a frontend mobile app (developed using React Native) to collect self-reported range data that will lead to efficiency statistics based on target distance and target radius. The reviewer could also glean an understanding of Aaron's desire to look at problems from a data driven perspective.
